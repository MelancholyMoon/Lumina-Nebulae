## Project Lumina

**Project Lumina** is the name of the narrative universe behind which we are developing multiple pieces of content and products. Project Lumina is an open project for everyone. Anyone can take part, provided they give credit to the creators, to the project itself, and, where applicable, to any products already developed, can make fan-made content and release it as part of the Project Lumina universe. We also plan to launch an official public wiki where anyone can request to add their own creations, characters and stories.

**Lumina Nebulae** is an official Project Lumina product, consequently, the events, characters, species, universe, and the content are connected to Project Lumina and may appear again in other Project Lumina products.

## How to download the game
